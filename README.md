# 📊 Business KPI Dashboard (Looker + BigQuery + Python)

This project turns messy spreadsheets into **actionable business insights**. Using **Google BigQuery** for scalable storage, **Looker** for interactive dashboards, and a **Python forecasting model**, it delivers a complete end-to-end analytics solution.

From **revenue and profit tracking → customer behavior analysis → future sales prediction**, everything is standardized, automated, and designed to help teams make faster, data-driven decisions.
